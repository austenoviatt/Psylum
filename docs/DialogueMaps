cin >> “ready”
I can be cold as the bluest, hottest ice And hot as the bluest, fiercest fire. . . I’m a false reflection of a conceptional misconception Whatever your limited or infinite mind’s desire
You listen to my loud, yet gentle vibration You believe me fully with no hesitation . . . You see me with all colors of the beautiful rainbow Is that really all the colors? Will you ever know? Only if you can let me go. . .

cin >> guess1
if(guess1 == “perception”)
	  event = completeRiddle;
 I’m young and younger, black and blacker Smart and wise. A genius. A true catalytic cracker Beautiful, and most beautiful – is there really such a thing? Breath in the melody that I most wonderfully sing!
I can be red, yellow, or indigo blue Although I’m real in essence, I’m never the truth, I’m at your worst, completely false; Incomplete at your best; a simple impulse.
I can be joyfully sorrowful and sorrowfully glee, too. But, whatever I am, I’m always completely real to you. Do you feel me! Do you get my point! Do you smell my noise? Can you hear my funk! Can you see my darkness? Can you touch my light! Can you smell my vision? Can you taste my sight!
Can you smell the painful pleasure,  Can you taste the agony of the estasy? No matter what, I’m always YOUR reality; I am in you and you are in me. If you change your perspective. I’ll change mine– as your’s reflective.

cin >> guess2;
if(guess2 == “perception”)
	  event = completeRiddle;
 I am oh so evil, and yet so kind The world would be nothingness if I were blind. But, maybe not-how dare I say? And now I lay me down to pray . . .
I pray that you free me every then and now From your dear self, for this I vow . . . Will free you from hypocrisies And all the false analogies. . . From judgements, prejudices, anger and hatred … These no longer exist, once I am emancipated.
My negation gives you insight, free and clear Of a far away place that is yet so near If you could release my blessed curse and damned grace And move beyond object, time and space For that brief moment in that sphere You’ll sense a unity so crystal clear Even beyond your limited, infinite imagination Who am I, I am simply . . .

cin >> guess3
if(guess3 == “perception”)
	  event = completeRiddle;
